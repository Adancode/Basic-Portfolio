		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<hr>
		<img src="assets/images/profile200x200.jpg" alt="profile picture">
		<p>I'm an entrepreneur that decided to learn to code because the future isn't going to build itself. My coding journey began in mid-2014, and I've now completed over 1,000 hours of self-study, which I've kept track of on blogger. In addition to my self-study, I'm currently attending The Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin, a full stack program which I'll be graduating from in October 2016.</p>
		<p>I'm also the founder and organizer of Free Code Camp - Austin, a meetup group whose purpose is to grow Austin's tech community by helping people transition into careers in web development. I've grown the group to close to 300 members and membership continues to grow steadily.</p>
